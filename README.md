This JavaScript code has five inactive parts: (1) the scrollContactBtn button may not exist in the HTML, (2) the contact section might be missing or have the wrong ID, (3) the alert() can be blocked by some browsers, (4) the script may run too early if not placed at the end of the HTML or without defer, and (5) there’s no error handling if elements aren’t found, causing the functions to silently fail.
